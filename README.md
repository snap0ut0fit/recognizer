Experimenting with the Facenet implementation on custom dataset. No copyright infringement intended.
Originally adapted from https://github.com/TessFerrandez/research-papers/tree/prod/facenet

Create a new folder called "models" and add the following "landmarks.dat" file to that folder. The file can be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IdYOG5Q4Cg3DCDEQhaAqmKs4ZJZVsIUG/view?usp=sharing

again this is just for experimental purposes and the ownership of the model belongs to dlib.
